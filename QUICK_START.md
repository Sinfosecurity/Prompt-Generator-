## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
- Be specific about the problem you're solving
- Select all relevant input/output types
- Write clear, simple descriptions
- Think about your users' actual needs
- Use the "Something else" option if nothing fits

### ❌ DON'T:
- Rush through the questions
- Leave fields empty (unless optional)
- Use technical jargon
- Over-complicate your idea
- Worry about being perfect - you can always start over

## Common Questions

### "What if I make a mistake?"
Click "↺ Start over" at the bottom of the results screen. It resets everything.

### "Can I save my prompts?"
Currently no, but you can:
1. Copy the prompt
2. Paste it into a text file
3. Save that file on your computer

### "Which builder should I choose?"
- **Don't know?** → Use "Universal"

### "The prompt is very long, is that normal?"
Yes! Good prompts are detailed. That's why the AI can build your app without asking questions.

### "Do I need to know coding?"
No! That's the point. You describe WHAT you want, the AI figures out HOW to build it.

## Example Walkthrough

**Goal:** Create an app that calculates freelance project prices

1. **App type:** Calculator / estimator
2. **Users:** Freelancers or solopreneurs
3. **Problem:** "Freelancers struggle to price projects accurately and often undercharge"
4. **Inputs:** Numbers (hours, hourly rate, expenses), Form fields (project details)
5. **Outputs:** Scores (final price), Explanations (breakdown), Recommendations (profit margin advice)
6. **Design:** Green and white, clean style, friendly tone, both platforms

**Result:** A detailed prompt ready to build a pricing calculator!

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I click Generate"
- Make sure you answered ALL questions in the current step
- Check for red error messages
- Try refreshing the page and starting over

### "Copy doesn't work"
- Your browser might be blocking clipboard access

### "The app won't open"
- Make sure you're double-clicking `index.html`
- If it opens in a text editor, right-click → Open With → Your Web Browser

## Need Help?

This is a simple tool with no backend. If something isn't working:
1. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. Try a different web browser
3. Make sure you're using a modern browser (updated in the last year)

## What Makes This Better Than Just Asking AI?

When you just ask AI "build me an invoice app", it will ask you 20 follow-up questions about:
- What fields should it have?
- What should it look like?
- Who will use it?
- What format should results be in?
- etc.

**PromptFoundry asks these questions FIRST**, so you give the AI everything it needs in ONE prompt. This is:
- ✅ Faster
- ✅ More precise
- ✅ Less frustrating
- ✅ Better results
